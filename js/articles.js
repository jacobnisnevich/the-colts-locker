    "article": "<p><p>Much has been made so far this draft season about the need for the Colts improve their offensive line in order to protect star quarterback Andrew Luck. With relatively few exceptions, most mock drafts have Indy drafting either Michigan State’s Jack Conklin or Ohio State’s Taylor Decker (both offensive tackles) with the 18<sup>th</sup> overall pick. Even if the assumption that improving the offensive line is the Colts’ highest priority for the 2016 draft (which I’m not sure it is), drafting one of the highly touted tackles might not be the best way to go about fixing the line. The argument that drafting a tackle would fix the Colts woes at pass protection is somewhat half-baked because the biggest issues the Colts have had in pass protection have come with pressure up the interior. Therefore, it is logical to draft a player who plays on the interior of the defensive line. One such player who could drastically improve the Colts’ play at guard is Stanford’s Josh Garnett.</p> <p>Garnett is the very definition of a mauler at guard. A former 5-star recruit, the Puyallup, Washington native stands an impressive 6’4” and 317 pounds, with 33 and 3/8” arms. The strongest area of his game is his ability to use his length and power to move defenders off the line of scrimmage as easily as any offensive lineman in college football. </p> <p>Watch #51, the left guard, as Garnett shows his strength:<div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='DeepHeavyEastrussiancoursinghounds'></div></p> <p>and again:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='AccomplishedHopefulGelding'></div></p> <p>I could go on:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='InsistentExemplaryCero'></div></p> <p>but I think you get the idea:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='WaterySplendidApe'></div></p> <p>In accordance with his massive frame and strength, Garnett isn’t exactly a herculean statue, and from this stem some of the largest concern with game. The ability to pull effectively is very important attribute for a guard, and Garnett’s athleticism can be suspect, as seen in this play, where Garnett just can't get downfield fast enough:</p> <div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='TanFreeButterfly'></div></p> <p>His balance can also cause him other problems, and a really good first stem from a defender often leaves him on the ground. He needs to work not allowing plays like this to happen often:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='DazzlingYellowishAnkolewatusi'></div> <p>Some issues also arise when has to block with power at an angle, and Garnett isn’t great at blocking down players who are getting around him: </p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='FrayedGenuineDachshund'></div></p> <p>His feet can be slow and his agility sometimes lets him down when tries to block in the open field, but when does properly engage, the results are very good; here Garnett engages with a linebacker easily and takes him out of the play:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='EnchantingEveryArchaeocete'></div></p> <p>Garnett knows how to use his size well, and he understand how to take a good angle when he engages blocks: In this play, he uses his size and weight instead of force to direct the linebacker out of the running backs rushing lane.</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='ElectricUnrulyAmethystinepython'></div></p> <p>This also belies another one of Garnett’s strengths; it is expected that Stanford players have high football IQ’s (and high IQ’s in general) but in the games that I watched Garnett never missed an assignment or seemed lost on a play. This probably isn't the flashiest trait, but any offensive coordinator will tell you how valuable it is to have a very reliable player in this sense. </p> <p>When it comes to getting downfield, Garnett does so in a hurry and latches onto linebackers like a leech. As I would expect new offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski to incorporate more zone blocking into Indy’s offense, this is invaluable. He shows his quality here in play, shoving around defenders at the second level and playing through the whistle.</p><p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='InexperiencedPresentAmericancurl'></div></p> <p>A big question the Colts should obviously ask of any offensive linemen is “can he pass block?” It plausible that Andrew Luck will average more than 35 passes a game next season, and it is imperative that the Colts keep him on his feet while he does so. As far as his pass pro goes, Josh Garnett holds up well. I wouldn’t expect his to lock down Aaron Donald for 35 straight plays, but he knows how to use his length well to occupy rushing linemen, as shown here:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='PlaintiveConcernedAntarcticgiantpetrel'></div> </p> <p>As far as off the field issues, Garnett has none to speak of. I’ve heard that he’s an extremely likeable and funny guy and that he’s expected to do very well in combine interviews, which could help him move up some draft boards, especially the Colts, as few front offices if any value character as highly as Ryan Grigson and Chuck Pagano. </p> <p>In conclusion, Josh Garnett would be a very good for Indianapolis to fill the right guard position. He appears to be a very low risk prospect and he would be tremendous addition to the Colts offensive line. His athletic profile is similar to Oakland Raiders guard Gabe Jackson, and while I don’t think Garnett has quite as much talent as Jackson, he could easily be a borderline Pro Bowl-level guard by the end of rookie contract. As far as draft value goes, I don’t think he’ll be a great value at pick no.18, but trading into the 20’s could make this a great pick. There would be sexier selections, and he’s not a player who would change the fortunes of the Colts, but adding him to the team would be a huge upgrade over the revolving door the Colts have had at right guard over the last few years.</p>"
