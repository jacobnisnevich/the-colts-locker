    "article": "<p><p>Since the 2015 season ended, multiple reports have surfaced about the Colts pursuing Michigan State offensive tackle Jack Conklin to help fix their offensive line woes. This, to me, was very unsurprising because of the success that incumbent LG starter Jack Mewhort has had in Indy since being selected in the second round of the 2014 Draft. General Manager Ryan Grigson has had his struggles with acquiring offensive linemen, and Mewhort is the only long-term starter currently on the roster that Grigson has brought in, and he may attempt to repeat that feat by drafting Conklin. </p> <p>The similarities between Mewhort and Conklin are numerous: for one thing, they have the same first name (I had to go for the low-hanging fruit on that one). They’re also both multi-year starters at left tackle at large and successful Big Ten programs who are projected by analysts to not be able to play that same role at an NFL level due to a lack of top-end agility. Their athletic profiles have many similarities:</p> <p><iframe src='http://mockdraftable.com/player_embed/5132/' frameborder='1' scrolling='no'></iframe></p> <p><iframe src='http://mockdraftable.com/player_embed/4552/' frameborder='1' scrolling='no'></iframe></p> <p>Mewhort and Conklin are the same height, the same weight, and Conklin’s arms are an inch longer. Based purely on their combine measurements, Conklin appears to be the more athletic of the two, especially with his impressive 20-yard shuttle time of 4.57 seconds (this is a metric which Ryan Grigson rates very highly with respect to offensive lineman). </p> <p>The most important trait for a Colts offensive lineman is the ability to pass protect. While I don’t buy into the narrative that the Colts should go for broke getting new lineman to protect resident golden goose Andrew Luck, it is an important thing for Grigson &amp; Co. to invest in. Conklin is a very strong player, and he knows how to use that strength in pass protection. Watch as a defender attempts to use brute force to push him back:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='CluelessRemarkableIaerismetalmark'></div></p> <p>In addition to this, Conklin does well against faster ends trying to get around him. A lot of tackles struggle with speed, but Conklin did well against college defenders who try to use just their first step to get past him:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='DimDelightfulIberiannase'></div></p> <p>Conklin is also very good at dealing with bullrushes, which in particular bodes well for his ability to kick inside and play guard:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='PresentDeadBoar'></div></p> <p>Conlin’s ability to use his length to corral opposing linemen and take them out of plays is impressive, and even when he can’t just force his opponent back, he does a great job of taking away the defender’s steam and keeping himself between the end and his quarterback:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='DamagedAbsoluteElk'></div></p> <p>Another major “plus” for Conklin’s pass pro is his hand usage. Conklin knows how to place his hands well on his opponent’s frame, and this is a major part of his ability to keep the defender at full arm’s length away. He shows this in one of his most noteworthy matchups facing Oregon defensive end (and in all likelihood future top-10 pick) DeForest Buckner here:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='MelodicGorgeousGaur'></div></p> <p>One of the first negatives I noticed about Conklin in pass pro was that he was prone to attempting mind-boggling block. I don’t know what this is:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='FlamboyantLastingAnemoneshrimp'></div></p> <p>Conklin also has other, more glaring weakness in pass protection. He’s somewhat slow to react and make contact at times, and he can especially struggle with certain pass-rushing moves. Watch how easily Buckner beats him here:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='PrestigiousNeglectedKangaroo'></div></p> <p>As far as his run blocking goes, Conklin is a nasty, powerful blocker who fights through the whistle. He uses his size and strength to drive through defenders and finishes his blocks very well for the most part. He knows how to take a good angle on his assignment and use his opponent’s momentum against them. Watch him shove around Oregon’s Buckner here:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='HeavenlyBasicArcticseal'></div></p> <p>Conklin’s punch is very strong and it’s really hard for a defender to find his footing after getting knocked by Conklin. This block shows a lot of the good and bad that you can expect from Conklin; he makes contact earnestly, forces the defender back, but Buckner disengages too easily and is able to assist the tackle:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='SameEmbellishedEasternnewt'></div></p> <p>His primary problems in run blocking arise from his mobility, or relative lack thereof. Conklin likes to make contact early, but if he has to move further than a step or two to make that block it becomes evident how slow he is:</p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='DimShrillGoldenmantledgroundsquirrel'></div></p> <p>Even when he can’t make early contact, when he faces a defender with comparable length and strength to him (which he will face in the NFL) he can have some bad plays. Again, I reference his game vs. Buckner to show this in action: </p> <p><div data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=false data-expand=true data-id='PoorThirdAntarcticfurseal'></div></p> <p>Conklin, to my knowledge, has no major medical concerns to speak of. He missed a few games over the last two years with minor injuries, but the Colts shouldn’t have any red flags on him in this regard.</p> <p>Another thing which may really make Conklin more attractive to the Colts is his walk-on status. While it also speaks to his lack of athleticism (there is a reason he was a walk-on), it also speaks very heavily to his work ethic and character; Conklin forced his way onto the Michigan State team and through hard work and perseverance dragged himself to being in the first round conversation. He is in every way a “horseshoe guy” that this team looks for in a prospect.</p> <p>In summation, Jack Conklin, like Jack Mewhort, is an unspectacular but very good offensive lineman. He won’t jump off the screen often with any plays that he makes, but he’ll turn up every down he plays with consistent effort and above average technique for a college offensive lineman. Like Mewhort, he could possibly be a right tackle in the NFL, but with speed rushers becoming more and more common, I think he’s a much better fit at guard for the Colts even though he is more suited to the position than Mewhort is. I think that he isn’t a great value to be taken with the 18<sup>th</sup> pick this year because I don’t think he does a whole lot to alleviate this team’s needs, but if he is taken nobody should go jumping off of bridges over it. I don’t expect him to attend many Pro Bowls, but Conklin is a very good football player who I think will be a slightly better version of Jack Mewhort once he gets to the next level.</p>"

    "article": "<p><p>Much has been made so far this draft season about the need for the Colts improve their offensive line in order to protect star quarterback Andrew Luck. With relatively few exceptions, most mock drafts have Indy drafting either Michigan State’s Jack Conklin or Ohio State’s Taylor Decker (both offensive tackles) with the 18<sup>th</sup> overall pick. Even if the assumption that improving the offensive line is the Colts’ highest priority for the 2016 draft (which I’m not sure it is), drafting one of the highly touted tackles might not be the best way to go about fixing the line. The argument that drafting a tackle would fix the Colts woes at pass protection is somewhat half-baked because the biggest issues the Colts have had in pass protection have come with pressure up the interior. Therefore, it is logical to draft a player who plays on the interior of the defensive line. One such player who could drastically improve the Colts’ play at guard is Stanford’s Josh Garnett.</p> <p>Garnett is the very definition of a mauler at guard. A former 5-star recruit, the Puyallup, Washington native stands an impressive 6’4” and 317 pounds, with 33 and 3/8” arms. The strongest area of his game is his ability to use his length and power to move defenders off the line of scrimmage as easily as any offensive lineman in college football. </p> <p>Watch #51, the left guard, as Garnett shows his strength:<div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='DeepHeavyEastrussiancoursinghounds'></div></p> <p>and again:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='AccomplishedHopefulGelding'></div></p> <p>I could go on:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='InsistentExemplaryCero'></div></p> <p>but I think you get the idea:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='WaterySplendidApe'></div></p> <p>In accordance with his massive frame and strength, Garnett isn’t exactly a herculean statue, and from this stem some of the largest concern with game. The ability to pull effectively is very important attribute for a guard, and Garnett’s athleticism can be suspect, as seen in this play, where Garnett just can't get downfield fast enough:</p> <div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='TanFreeButterfly'></div></p> <p>His balance can also cause him other problems, and a really good first stem from a defender often leaves him on the ground. He needs to work not allowing plays like this to happen often:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='DazzlingYellowishAnkolewatusi'></div> <p>Some issues also arise when has to block with power at an angle, and Garnett isn’t great at blocking down players who are getting around him: </p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='FrayedGenuineDachshund'></div></p> <p>His feet can be slow and his agility sometimes lets him down when tries to block in the open field, but when does properly engage, the results are very good; here Garnett engages with a linebacker easily and takes him out of the play:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='EnchantingEveryArchaeocete'></div></p> <p>Garnett knows how to use his size well, and he understand how to take a good angle when he engages blocks: In this play, he uses his size and weight instead of force to direct the linebacker out of the running backs rushing lane.</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='ElectricUnrulyAmethystinepython'></div></p> <p>This also belies another one of Garnett’s strengths; it is expected that Stanford players have high football IQ’s (and high IQ’s in general) but in the games that I watched Garnett never missed an assignment or seemed lost on a play. This probably isn't the flashiest trait, but any offensive coordinator will tell you how valuable it is to have a very reliable player in this sense. </p> <p>When it comes to getting downfield, Garnett does so in a hurry and latches onto linebackers like a leech. As I would expect new offensive coordinator Rob Chudzinski to incorporate more zone blocking into Indy’s offense, this is invaluable. He shows his quality here in play, shoving around defenders at the second level and playing through the whistle.</p><p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='InexperiencedPresentAmericancurl'></div></p> <p>A big question the Colts should obviously ask of any offensive linemen is “can he pass block?” It plausible that Andrew Luck will average more than 35 passes a game next season, and it is imperative that the Colts keep him on his feet while he does so. As far as his pass pro goes, Josh Garnett holds up well. I wouldn’t expect his to lock down Aaron Donald for 35 straight plays, but he knows how to use his length well to occupy rushing linemen, as shown here:</p> <p><div class='gfyitem' data-title=false data-autoplay=true data-controls=true data-expand=true data-id='PlaintiveConcernedAntarcticgiantpetrel'></div> </p> <p>As far as off the field issues, Garnett has none to speak of. I’ve heard that he’s an extremely likeable and funny guy and that he’s expected to do very well in combine interviews, which could help him move up some draft boards, especially the Colts, as few front offices if any value character as highly as Ryan Grigson and Chuck Pagano. </p> <p>In conclusion, Josh Garnett would be a very good for Indianapolis to fill the right guard position. He appears to be a very low risk prospect and he would be tremendous addition to the Colts offensive line. His athletic profile is similar to Oakland Raiders guard Gabe Jackson, and while I don’t think Garnett has quite as much talent as Jackson, he could easily be a borderline Pro Bowl-level guard by the end of rookie contract. As far as draft value goes, I don’t think he’ll be a great value at pick no.18, but trading into the 20’s could make this a great pick. There would be sexier selections, and he’s not a player who would change the fortunes of the Colts, but adding him to the team would be a huge upgrade over the revolving door the Colts have had at right guard over the last few years.</p>"
